Day One
=================================================

On your first day, just getting your laptop set up would be a great start. The very first thing we'll do is request the necessary permissions for access to different folders so you can do your work.

These take a few days to come through, so it's best to request them early. It is also a good chance to get familiar with our IT system, which is a bit complicated. 

To get the access, you need to raise a ticket on our IT system, which you can find [here](https://strykercorp.service-now.com/sp).

**Admin Rights**

#. Open up the link above for requesting access.
#. Click ‘Get IT’.
#. Search ‘admin’.
#. Click ‘Admin Rights Request’.
#. Fill out the form as shown below.

You may hear from IT asking for further information, just tell them you need it for your job and your manager has asked you to request admin rights.
